    <h1>Neutron Stars</h1>
    <p>Neutron stars are city-size stellar objects with a mass  about 1.4 times that of the sun. Born from the explosive death of other, larger  stars, these tiny objects pack a punch. Let's take a look at what they are, how  they form, and how they vary.</p>

    <h2>How do they form?</h2>
    <p>When stars four to eight times as massive as the sun explode  in a violent supernova, their outer layers can blow off in an often-spectacular  display, leaving behind a small, dense core that continues to collapse. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravity">Gravity</a> presses the material in on itself so tightly that protons and electrons combine  to make neutrons, yielding the name &ldquo;neutron star.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>Neutron stars are not very massive but are extremely  dense.  Our Milky Way galaxy has about  100 million Neutron Stars.</p>

	<h2>Galactic Lighthouses</h2>
    <p>Pulsars are rotating neutron stars observed to have pulses  of radiation at very regular intervals that typically range from milliseconds  to seconds. Pulsars have very strong magnetic fields which funnel jets of  particles out along the two magnetic poles. </p>
    <p>These accelerated particles produce very powerful beams of  light. Like a lighthouse they emit a beam of light that sweeps across the sky.  When the beam crosses our line-of-sight, we see a pulse – in other words, we  see pulsars turn on and off as the beam sweeps over Earth.  All pulsars are neutron stars, but not all  neutron stars are pulsars.</p>

    <h2>Magnetic Monsters</h2>
    <p>Magnetars are a kind of neutron star with a powerful  magnetic field. In a typical neutron star, the magnetic field is trillions of  times that of the Earth&rsquo;s magnetic field; however, in a magnetar, the magnetic  field is another 1000 times stronger.</p>
    <p>In all neutron stars, the crust of the star is locked  together with the magnetic field so that any change in one affects the other.  The crust is under an immense amount of strain, and a small movement of the  crust can be explosive. In a magnetar, movements in the crust cause the neutron  star to release a vast amount of energy in the form of electromagnetic  radiation called a <a href="https://www.space.com/1321-biggest-starquake.html">starquake</a>.</p>
